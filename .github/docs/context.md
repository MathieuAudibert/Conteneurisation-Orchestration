# Context

The objective of this project is to *simulate the complete lifecycle of a modern application*, from its design using microservices to its deployment in production, including automation. 

Students will not only have to develop a functional application but also build all the underlying infrastructure to make it run in a **resilient, scalable, and automated way**.
This project aims to place you in the shoes of a DevOps team, where you are responsible for both the code (Dev) and the infrastructure (Ops).

 The final presentation will be oriented toward showcasing these technical skills to a **recruiter**.
